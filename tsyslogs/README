Our script
     ./tsys.py AGBT21B_024_10
makes the file
     pro/AGBT21B_024_10.tsys
which should be copied here and saved in git in this tsyslogs directory

The command "make tsys SEQ=32" does this, and gives a reminder to the git
commands needed to add them to git. 

Missing sessions are:
 09  - equipment failure
 16  - skipped for some reason

The columns in the tables are:

1   scan number
2   mean Tsys over all (16) beams
3   rms Tsys
4   min Tsys
5   max Tsys
6   Tcal      (added Mar 2025)
7   Twarm
8   Tatm
9   tau0 (zenith opacity)

Somwtimes it happens that the az,el are listed as 0, in which case
Tsys will be reported as infinity and all related calibration will
be bad.
In the vanecal procesure, use the maint=1 option, where it will use
some nominal elevation, so some reasonable Tsys comes out.

The Tcal,Twarm,Tatm,tau0 column were added from session 64 onwards,
and will have to be recomputed backwards if we care for offsite
calibration.
